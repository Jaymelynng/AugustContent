          <li><strong>Focus on emotions:</strong> The facial expressions and body language tell the story more than the specific activities</li>
          <li><strong>Consistent lighting:</strong> Try to maintain similar lighting conditions across all 6 photos for a cohesive collage</li>
          <li><strong>Natural moments:</strong> The best shots happen when kids aren't posing - capture authentic interactions</li>
          <li><strong>The journey matters:</strong> Each photo should feel like a natural progression from shy to confident</li>

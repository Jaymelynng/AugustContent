        <p>
          This post pulls back the curtain on the secret weapon behind a powerful roundoff: the 'mountain climber' setup. We will use a "right vs. wrong" comparison to show parents how one small change in shape can fuel an entirely different level of power, which I will edit after it's turned in. The goal is to create a mini-lesson that showcases our expert-level coaching.

        <h3>üìå Content Notes</h3>
        <p>üé• <strong>All three pieces of content (2 photos, 1 video) need to be filmed from the same place and angle.</strong> This is important so the comparison into the video works. If you can't film everything at once, set markers like tape on the floor to mark where the front and back foot positions are so we can maintain consistency.</p>
        
        <p>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>The goal is to capture the clean, raw footage - I'll edit later on (adding arrows, angle lines, checkmarks, text overlays, etc.).</strong> I'll transform it into the final educational content piece.</p>

              <li>‚úÖ <strong>The Feeling:</strong> You should feel like a compressed spring or a slingshot pulled, ready to explode forward</li>
              <li><strong>Feet Straight:</strong> Not out to the side</li>
              <li><strong>Arms Straight by Ears:</strong> Arms straight, held tightly next to their ears</li>

This low, loaded position is the 'sinking down' that gathers all the energy from the floor needed for an explosive takeoff into the roundoff.

        <p>
          This comparison shows parents the difference between <strong>power-building</strong> and <strong>power-leaking</strong> positions. One small shape change = entirely different level of performance. It's a perfect example of our expert coaching attention to detail.
